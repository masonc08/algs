# Rabin-Karp
- String matching algorithm similar to KMP
- uses rolling hash to check similarities of string
- good for comparing collections of patterns against one string as it is easy to compare hashes
- traverse string as a rolling window of the size of the pattern and compare hashes of each window to the pattern
  - if hashes are the same, manually compare the substring and the string to check if they are the same
- a good rolling hash uses sum of `ascii(c)*p^i`, where...
  - `c` is the character in the window,
  - `p` is a prime number,
  - and `i` is the position of character `c` in the window
- hash of next window can be calculated from the previous using a formula, this is why it's called a rolling hash
  - with the example above, `hash(i) = (hash(i-i)-ascii(l))/p+ascii(c)*p^n)`, where...
   - `i` is the starting index of the new window,
   - `l` is the evicted character from the previous window,
   - `c` is the new character of the new window,
   - `p` is the unique prime number,
   - and `n` is the length of the sliding window - 1
